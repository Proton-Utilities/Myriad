# Myriad General Validity Test

<https://discord.gg/nn4NxHU3Pu>

Myriad is an open-source standardization, functionality, and mitigations test for executors.

After the discontinuation of [UNC](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard), multiple forks and continuations of it have popped up, as well as separate general executor tests such as vulnerability tests and identity tests. Myriad hopes to achieve these as one, unified test.
